### Probability distributions

- Binomial
  - [Negative binomial for gene expression]{style="color: red;"}

### Statistical tests

- Fisher's Exact Test
  - A more precise (exact) version of Chi-square test but computationally intensive for large data
  - Calculates probability using factorials while Chi-square uses distribution (so works for larger data)
