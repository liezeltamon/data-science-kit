# Key concepts and differences of Python vs. R

## Basic

- Booleans should be written as True and False always
- Ranges do not include end of range
- Indentation needed to define heirarchy in if-else and for loop blocks

## Data structures

- By default, if a dictionary is modified all variables pointing to it gets the modification i.e. modify in place behaviour (unlike R's default copy-on-modify behaviour)
- Dictionaries could be like lists, if the keys used are indexes
