### Single-cell sequencing protocols

1.  3 types of protocols mainly differentiated by cell isolation method
    -   Cells in droplets (microfluidics)
        -   Captures only 3' of transcript (R2 end, R1 + cell barcode + UMI at 5')
        -   10x Genomics Chromium (outperformed two other similar methods but 2x more expensive per cell, Zhang et al. 2019)
2.  Potential biases
    1.  Protocols have biases for certain transcripts
        -   "10X Genomics favored the capture and amplification of shorter genes and genes with higher GC content" - Scbp (Single-cell best practices)
    2.  Some cell types more vulnerable to dissociation (e.g. non-neuronal cells survive better than neurons - Darmanis et al. 2015, Scbp)

### Raw data processing

1.  Get FASTQ files (Sequence + quality)
2.  Check FASTQ sequence read quality - FastQC()
    -   MultiQC() can be used to combine FastQC reports from each FASTQ
